- 👋 Hi, I’m Luna.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot too much stuff that I sometimes barely understand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly make music, specifically how to master.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I can actually help on, like not many things.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord @🌔 L u n a L o m e t t a .#0049, https://twitter.com/sealovedmoon and https://www.instagram.com/sealovedmoon
